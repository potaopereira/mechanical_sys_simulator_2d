# Simulator for Two Dimensional Mechanical Systems

A Mechanical system is a system composed of ``N`` rigid bodies.
Individually, each rigid body ``i`` has a pose ``p`` and a twist ``v``.
Collectively, a mechanical system has a pose ``P`` and a twist ``V``.

A mechanial system is defined by the constraints imposed on its pose ``P`` and twist ``V``.
